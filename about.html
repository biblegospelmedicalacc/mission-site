    <h2>About our Mission</h2>

      <p>
        For decades, Pastor Othello Caturan and his wife, Felinda, have faithfully served the underserved communities of the Philippines, combining compassionate medical care with the life-transforming message of Jesus Christ. Their mission is more than healing bodies—it is about healing souls, bringing hope, salvation, and restoration through the Gospel.
      </p>

      <p>
        Traveling into remote and often forgotten regions, they embody Christ’s love by meeting physical needs while sharing the eternal truth of God's Word. Their work has sparked new faith in countless hearts, turning stories of struggle into testimonies of grace. Through medical outreaches, they nurture communities, strengthen churches, and inspire new generations of believers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Looking beyond today, Pastor Othello and Felinda continue to build a legacy of service, envisioning sanctuaries of refuge and care for orphans, the elderly, and displaced families—a reflection of God’s heart for the vulnerable.
